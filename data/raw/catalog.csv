ARCH,2330,Structures 1,"Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life and life cycle cost.",Prerequisite: ARCH 2510 except M.Arch. students.,Fall term annually.,ARCH 5140 Structures 1.,3,ARCH-2330,['ARCH-2510'],[]

The interdependence among building materials, acoustic qualities, enclosure systems, interior, finish, and other systems is investigated, with an emphasis on the broader architectural design endeavor. Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups. Case studies will center on concepts and systems that have not yet found their way into mainstream practice. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability.

ARCH,4070,Twisted Siblings: Relationships Between Contemporary Painting and Digital Architecture,"Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both.

Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is 'open data?' What does it mean to 'share' data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy?
