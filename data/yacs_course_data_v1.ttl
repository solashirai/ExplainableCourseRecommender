Specific structural typologies are examined through historic and contemporary project examples that are critically deconstructed and critically analyzed with respect to their basic engineering principles and architectural concepts. Students will be exposed to the collaborative methods inherent within the architect/engineer relationship. The course consists of lectures concerning each topic, case studies, and presentations of relevant projects, an interdisciplinary design project and discussion of the projects and presentations with respect to interdisciplinary discourse. Content and delivery may vary by instructor. Taught with CIVL 4020."^^xsd:string ;

In continuing the inquiry begun in The Ethos of Architecture and employing the skills and values acquired in that course and Architectural Media, the intent of this course is to teach students the means for investigating buildings coherently, rationally, and interpretively to understand the technical and cultural knowledge embedded within works of architecture. A select number of modern and contemporary buildings that represent a high degree of sophistication in the way their architects have approached the breadth of design issues both within and external to the programs of those works will be analyzed critically in order to ascertain the significance and relationships of the multiple systems of order inherent to a work of architecture."^^xsd:string ;

As such, the content of the course must necessarily evolve as the intellectual and cultural parameters of both theory and practice in the contemporary world change. The principal aim of the critique of various contemporary positions is to reinforce in students the importance of developing and critically maintaining their own values, vision, and voice in the design and making of architecture that was initiated in ARCH 2150, The Ethos of Architecture. Fundamental to this process is to encourage the students' awareness of the necessity to challenge their own subjectivities, biases, and presuppositions."^^xsd:string ;

    crs-onto:hasDescription "The second semester of the Sonics Research Lab includes advanced acoustical measurement techniques. Another important part of the semester curriculum concerns noise sources, noise control, and vibration measurements. State-of-the-art, commercial software and school research-based software will be used for simulation/analysis/measurement of room acoustics in order to show the students how such technical tools assist in acoustics research and consulting practice for the design of performance and public spaces. The course will also give students a deeper theoretical understanding of architectural acoustics in order to assist them in room acoustics research. There will also be labs to reflect typical measurement procedures and (if time permits) site visits to acoustics research labs and different types of acoustical spaces. The Sonics Research Lab II emphasizes more training on independent hands-on and problem-solving skills (than the SRL I).  B.S. and B.Arch., and other school students can only register for the 4000 level of this course and M.S.Arch. students must register only for the 6000 level of this course."^^xsd:string ;

Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA).

As a follow-up to the ethics instruction in USAR 4010, the course starts with a foundation in the legal aspects of decision making and leadership. The curriculum reinforces previous instruction on the organization of the Army and introduces how the Army organizes for operations from the tactical to the strategic level. This is followed by instruction on administrative and logistical management that will focus on the fundamentals of soldier and unit level support. At the core of the semester is the Advanced Course Capstone Exercise. This 12-lesson exercise incorporates learning objectives from the entire military science curriculum. The capstone exercise will require students, both individually and collectively, to apply their knowledge to solve problems and confront situations commonly faced by junior officers. Upon completion of the course, students will be prepared for the responsibility of being a commissioned officer in the United States Army."^^xsd:string ;

Similarly, the concept of a 'policy,' high-level guidelines providing a general course of action (or inaction) in a given area, is not new. Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is 'open data?' What does it mean to 'share' data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy? This course takes the basics of policy design and analysis, blends in critical thinking skills, ethics, group dynamics, national perspectives, and international perspectives, and applies it all to the world of big data."^^xsd:string ;

    crs-onto:hasDescription "Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: the following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life and life cycle cost.

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle."^^xsd:string ;

It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions.
